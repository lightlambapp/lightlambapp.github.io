## Privacy Policy for Light Lamb app

We, the Light Lamb app, do not want your data. We will always try to minimize the amount of data that we collect.

We currently do not collect any data.

We need to use your device's camera to read the light. We do not keep any of the images unless you save it as a memo, in which case we save it on your device only.

The Light Lamb app works works completely offline. Nothing is sent to our servers nor third party servers.

As features are added to the app in the future, we might allow you to save some of your data. The app will always be clear about where data are kept and what's going to happen with your data. This privacy policy will be updated to reflect the changes.

If you have any more questions, please contact us at [lamb@lightlamb.com](mailto:lamb@lightlamb.com).

Last updated: 2022-02-28 for memo feature added in version 1.1.0.
