## Privacy Policy for Light Lamb app

We, the Light Lamb app, do not want your data. We will always try to minimize the amount of data that we collect.

We currently do not collect any data.

Permissions we ask for in the app:
- Camera: for reading the light level and capturing memos
- Adding photos: for saving memo picture notes to your photo library
- Location: for adding location information to memos

Nothing is sent to us or any third party in the app. We do not keep any information unless you save them as a memo.

As features are added to the app in the future, we might allow you to save some of your data. We will always be clear about where data are kept and what's going to happen with your data. This privacy policy will be updated to reflect the changes.

If you have any more questions, please contact us at [lamb@lightlamb.com](mailto:lamb@lightlamb.com).

Last updated: 2022-04-02 for memo feature with location added in version 1.2.0.
