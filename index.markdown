# Light Lamb

Light Lamb is a free photographers' light meter app for iOS. Designed with direct one-handed control and computer assistance in mind. Itâ€™s like getting an auto mode on your manual film camera.

## Assisted manual control

If the manual settings entered are too dark or too bright for the scene, Light Lamb can suggest changes to ensure the perfect exposure.

## Safe shutter-aware

You can provide a preferred slowest shutter speed and we will try to match it. If the scene is too dark, we will automatically pick a slower shutter speed to achieve the correct exposure.

## Spot metering

Zoom in to focus the measurements to small areas in contrasting scenes.

## Match your equipment

Choose the range of ISO, aperture, and shutter speed to match your equipment. Choose between whole-stop, half-stop, and one-third EV increments for each parameter.
