# Light Lamb

Light Lamb is a free photographers' light meter app for iOS. Designed with direct one-handed control and computer assistance in mind. Itâ€™s like getting an auto mode on your manual film camera.

![Exposure settings suggested by Light Lamb](/assets/settings_unlocked.png){:class="img-responsive assisted-manual"}

## Assisted manual control

If the manual settings entered are too dark or too bright for the scene, Light Lamb can suggest changes to ensure the perfect exposure.

Want to shoot at f/8 and 1/125s? Or using ISO 400 film but still want to open up the aperture as much as you could? Just set it to what you want and Light Lamb will handle the rest.

Lock the ISO to match the film you are using, or unlock it to check what ISO to use.

## Safe shutter-aware

You can provide a preferred slowest shutter speed and we will try to match it. If the scene is too dark, we will automatically pick a slower shutter speed to achieve the correct exposure.

## Spot metering

Zoom in 5x to focus the measurements to small areas in contrasting scenes.

## Match your equipment

Choose the range of ISO, aperture, and shutter speed to match your equipment. Choose between whole-stop, half-stop, and one-third EV increments for each parameter.
