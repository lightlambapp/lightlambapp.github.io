Light Lamb is developed by a solo independent developer, who shoots both digital and film as a hobby.

Metering light is just the start. Light Lamb is intended to be a film photographers' companion.

We would love to hear about what you think about Light Lamb. How you use it, what you like, what you don't like, what problems you are having, what you would like to see added.
